# rt3conf

An *unofficial* tool for configuring Railroad Tycoon 3.

Railroad Tycoon is trademarked by Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., and this
software is not affiliated with them in any way.

## Reverse Engineering Fields

The configuration files contain fields that control the configuration settings.
The configuration files are binary so there is no explanation of what each
field does. The function of each field was reversed engineered by changing a
setting in the game and then observing the changes to the files. I used
[wxHexEditor](https://www.wxhexeditor.org/) to find the changes. It has a
feature to compare the contents of two binary files.
